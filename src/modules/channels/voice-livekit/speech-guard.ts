/**
 * The last thing between the LLM and the caller's ear.
 *
 * Two failures on Koren's first Keren-v2 call, both caught only by reading the transcript, and both
 * things a prompt cannot reliably prevent — so they are stopped in code, at the point where text
 * becomes sound.
 *
 *
 * 1. SHE SAID A CONTROL TOKEN OUT LOUD. Twice.
 *
 *      [204s] KEREN  NO_RESPONSE_NEEDED
 *      [393s] KEREN  NO_RESPONSE_NEEDED
 *
 *    The v2 prompt is a RETELL prompt, and Retell has a convention: emit `NO_RESPONSE_NEEDED` and
 *    the platform stays silent. LiveKit has no such convention, so the string went straight to
 *    Cartesia and Cartesia read it aloud, in English, to a Hebrew caller who had just asked her to
 *    hold on. Nothing in a prompt will stop this reliably — the model is doing exactly what it was
 *    told. The platform has to honour it.
 *
 *
 * 2. SHE CLAIMED TO HAVE BOOKED A MEETING THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
 *
 *      [303s] KEREN  מעולה, שמחה לשמוע. קבעתי לך שיחת דמו למחר
 *      [413s] KEREN  ...הדמו למחר ב-10. תקבל אישור, תודה רבה ונדבר!
 *
 *    No calendar was touched. No tool was called — this agent HAS no tools yet. The lead hangs up
 *    believing he has a demo tomorrow at 10 and a confirmation on its way, and nobody ever rings
 *    him. That is worse than any crash, because it looks like success to everyone involved.
 *
 *    The prompt tells her to call `book_appointment_cal` before saying this. She cannot. So she
 *    says it anyway — a model instructed to use a tool it does not have will improvise the outcome.
 *    Until Phase 4 wires the tools, the ONLY safe thing is to stop the sentence from leaving.
 *
 *    We do not silence her — silence mid-sentence is its own failure. We REWRITE the claim into the
 *    truth: she is passing the request to the team. That is what actually happens.
