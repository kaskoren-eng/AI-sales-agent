/**
 * The noise a person makes while thinking.
 *
 * WHY. Koren, mid-call, to the agent: "אוקיי. סיימת? אני פשוט לא מדבר, אני מחכה שתסיימי."
 * He could not tell whether she was thinking or had simply stopped talking, so he sat in silence
 * waiting for a machine that was also silent. The problem is not the delay — a human takes just as
 * long to answer a hard question. The problem is that a human FILLS the gap, and nobody minds.
 *
 * THESE ARE NOT SENTENCES, AND THAT IS THE POINT. He asked for exactly this: "not the full sentence,
 * just the noise that people do when they think." A filler that says something ("תן לי לבדוק את זה
 * בשבילך") is a reply, and it makes a promise she may not keep. A filler that just hesitates is
 * honest and costs nothing.
 *
 * They are also SHORT on purpose. Once the filler starts, the real answer queues behind it — so a
 * long filler does not soften the wait, it lengthens it. Every one of these is under a second.
 *
 * HEBREW, NOT TRANSLATED ENGLISH. "אממ" and "רגע" are what Israelis actually say. "בוא נראה" reads
 * naturally; "ובכן" would sound like a newsreader. This is the difference between an agent that
 * sounds like a person and one that sounds like a person translating.
 *
 * ── ROUND 10, 2026-08-31 — ALL FOUR SPELLINGS CHANGED, ALL FOUR BY EAR ────────────────────────
 *
 * This bank had never been screened at all, in any round, by any method — not by ear, not by round
 * trip. It was four spellings somebody wrote down. Koren heard each of them in the carrier the
 * production pipeline actually speaks them in
 * (`tests/hebrew-tts-niqqud-ab/index-round10.html`, cards `f2`–`f5`) and moved every one:
 *
 *   `אממ...`  → `אֶממ...`   (f3, D — segol on the alef)
 *   `רגע...`  → `רֶגַע...`  (f4, B — pointed)
 *   `שנייה...` → `שניה...`  (f5, B — defective spelling, one yod)
 *   `אה...`   → `אֶה...`    (f2, D — segol)
 *
 * ⚠️ THE NIQQUD IN THREE OF THESE DOES NOT SURVIVE THE PIPELINE ON ITS OWN. `guardSpeech` strips
 * every Hebrew point before the text reaches Cartesia, because MODEL-emitted pointing is unreliable
 * (known-issues §13) — and the injected filler goes through `guardStream` like any other text, so a
 * mark written here alone would be silently erased and Koren's verdict silently reverted. What makes
 * it reach the voice is `PRONUNCIATION_FIXES` in speech-guard.ts, which re-applies these three
 * marks AFTER the strip, scoped to the ellipsis so ordinary "רגע, בודקת." is untouched. The two
 * halves must be changed together; `speech-guard.test.ts` pins the round trip through `guardSpeech`.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND `אֶממ` NOW SHARES A STEM WITH THE RECEIPT `אמ.` — see ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS_HE and
 * `mayPairInOneBreath`. Two sounds that differ by one letter must never share one breath.

 * the v2 prompt is long and the LLM crosses the threshold constantly.
 *
 * A person hesitates once or twice in a conversation. Twenty-one times is not thinking, it is a

 * (a step that follows a tool call opens with a hesitation instead of a second acknowledgement —
 * see chooseTurnOpener), and two spenders with one budget need a shared object or they double-spend
 * the cap and repeat each other's words.
 *
 * OFFER, THEN COMMIT — and that split is load-bearing. A filler is ARMED long before we know
 * whether it will be spoken: on a step whose only output is a tool call there is no reply to glue
 * it to, and `withFiller` drops it. Counting at arm time would burn the call's three fillers on
 * words nobody ever heard, which is exactly how a slow, tool-heavy call ends up silent.
